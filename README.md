# Crypto Project Metadata Collector

This repository contains a suite of Python scripts for scraping, classifying, and merging metadata about cryptocurrency projects from CoinMarketCap. The goal is to build a structured dataset including project links, GitHub repositories, and first token trading dates, to support deeper analysis of open-source crypto ecosystems with github activities and different funding models.

## Project Workflow

1. **Scrape CoinMarketCap Coin List**  
   `scrape_coin_list.py`  
   - Extracts coin names and their CoinMarketCap links.  
   - Saves to: `your output file`

2. **Get First Token Trading Date**  
   `scrape_token_dates.py`  
   - Uses Selenium to hover over CoinMarketCap charts and find the first date with price data.  
   - Saves to: `your output file`

3. **Extract Website and Social Links**  
   `extract_all_links.py`  
   - Extracts all available external links from each coin’s CoinMarketCap page (website, GitHub, whitepaper, explorers, etc.).  
   - Saves to: `your output file`

4. **Clean and Deduplicate Extracted Links**  
   `cleaned_up_links.py`  
   - Cleans and reclassifies extracted links (e.g., GitHub, Whitepaper, Explorers) into a consistent format.  
   - Filters out noise like repeated CoinMarketCap social links and consolidates related columns.  
   - Output is a cleaned version of the extracted file.

5. **Merge Across Multiple Files (Optional)**  
   `merge_all_links.py`  
   - If you scraped in batches (e.g., 1–1000, 1001–2000), use this script to merge cleaned files.  
   - Groups by project name and keeps the first valid non-empty value per column.

6. **Merge Metadata with OSS Info**  
   `merge_project_data.py`  
   - Combines token dates, CoinMarketCap metadata, and GitHub OSS links into one final file.  
   - Saves to: `your output file`

## Notes

- For heavy scraping (over hundreds of coins), you may want to add random sleep intervals and use checkpoint saving to avoid losing progress.
- Coin names may not always match OSS GitHub repositories directly, so link classification is essential.
- Selenium scripts can be resource-intensive; ensure ChromeDriver is up-to-date.
